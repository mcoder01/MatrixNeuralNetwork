# MatrixNeuralNetwork
A Java library which implements a Neural Network using matrices.

This kind of library can be used when we want to create neural networks trained by supervised learning.

Pros:
- Easy to implement
- Trainable with supervised learning

Cons:
- The structure of the network can't be modified on runtime
- To train the network we must know the expected outputs given the inputs
